# invisible-load-working-mothers
Women who work full-time while raising children often carry an invisible load—unpaid labor, mental planning, emotional work, and constant coordination. This work is rarely measured, undervalued, or reflected in performance metrics, yet it directly affects burnout, career growth, relationships, and personal dreams.
# The Invisible Load of Working Mothers

## End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview

Women who work full-time while raising children often carry an **invisible load**—unpaid labor, mental planning, emotional work, and constant coordination. This work is rarely measured, undervalued, or reflected in performance metrics, yet it directly affects burnout, career growth, relationships, and personal dreams.

This project uses **data analytics** to make invisible work visible.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize the unpaid labor and mental load carried by working mothers who:

* Work full-time
* Are default parents
* Have little or no external support ("no village")
* Aim to be high performers at work
* Want to maintain healthy relationships
* Continue pursuing personal goals

---

## ❓ Key Questions

* How many hours per week are spent on **paid vs unpaid work**?
* What contributes most to mental load?
* How does lack of support impact burnout and well-being?
* What trade-offs are women making to sustain performance?
* Does partner support reduce burnout more than income?

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses

* Working mothers without external support perform **20–35 hours of unpaid labor per week**.
* Mental load contributes more to burnout than physical tasks.
* Strong partner support reduces burnout significantly.
* High performers sacrifice rest and personal time first.

---

## 📊 Data Source

**Primary Data (Planned):**

* Anonymous survey responses from working mothers
* Data collected via Google Forms / Typeform

**Secondary Data (Optional):**

* Public time-use datasets (OECD, national statistics)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Google Forms (data collection)
* Excel / Google Sheets (cleaning)
* SQL (analysis)
* Python (EDA – optional)
* Tableau / Power BI (visualization)
* GitHub (documentation & version control)

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

This project combines **data, social impact, and lived experience**. It demonstrates the ability to:

* Frame ambiguous problems
* Collect and clean real-world data
* Translate numbers into human stories
* Communicate insights clearly

The goal is not just analysis—but **visibility**.

Excel work list >📌 Project: Paid Hours Data Cleaning

Problem:
The dataset contained inconsistent text formats, ranges, symbols, and missing values.

Cleaning Steps:
- Trimmed extra spaces
- Converted text to lowercase
- Removed symbols (hrs, +, ~, ish)
- Extracted min and max hours
- Handled missing and non-numeric values

Missing Values Strategy:
- Left as NULL when uncertain
- Flagged values like 'depends' separately

Outcome:
A standardized, analysis-ready dataset.
