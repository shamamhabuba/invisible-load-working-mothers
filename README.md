# invisible-load-working-mothers
Women who work full-time while raising children often carry an invisible load—unpaid labor, mental planning, emotional work, and constant coordination. This work is rarely measured, undervalued, or reflected in performance metrics, yet it directly affects burnout, career growth, relationships, and personal dreams.
# The Invisible Load of Working Mothers

## End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview

Women who work full-time while raising children often carry an **invisible load**—unpaid labor, mental planning, emotional work, and constant coordination. This work is rarely measured, undervalued, or reflected in performance metrics, yet it directly affects burnout, career growth, relationships, and personal dreams.

This project uses **data analytics** to make invisible work visible.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize the unpaid labor and mental load carried by working mothers who:

* Work full-time
* Are default parents
* Have little or no external support ("no village")
* Aim to be high performers at work
* Want to maintain healthy relationships
* Continue pursuing personal goals

---

## ❓ Key Questions

* How many hours per week are spent on **paid vs unpaid work**?
* What contributes most to mental load?
* How does lack of support impact burnout and well-being?
* What trade-offs are women making to sustain performance?
* Does partner support reduce burnout more than income?

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses

* Working mothers without external support perform **20–35 hours of unpaid labor per week**.
* Mental load contributes more to burnout than physical tasks.
* Strong partner support reduces burnout significantly.
* High performers sacrifice rest and personal time first.

---

## 📊 Data Source

**Primary Data (Planned):**

* Anonymous survey responses from working mothers
* Data collected via Google Forms / Typeform

**Secondary Data (Optional):**

* Public time-use datasets (OECD, national statistics)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Google Forms (data collection)
* Excel / Google Sheets (cleaning)
* SQL (analysis)
* Python (EDA – optional)
* Tableau / Power BI (visualization)
* GitHub (documentation & version control)
